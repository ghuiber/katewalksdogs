What you see in the picture at Joe's feet is a brush. I know it doesn't look like one, but it is and it works great. It is also super easy to clean. That is a good thing, because I like keeping my kit in good working order. Joe sheds a lot and he loves a good brushing. If your dog does too, brushing is $5 extra and well worth it.
