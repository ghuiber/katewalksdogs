Title: About Me

My name is Kate and I live within walking distance of Mountain Lake Park. If you do too, I can walk your dog. An evening walk to the Mountain Lake Park dog play area at the 8th Ave steps from your house and back will cost $5. It includes 10 minutes of play time. I work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
